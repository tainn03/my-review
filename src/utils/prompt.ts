export const generatePullRequestReview = (

Your task is to review the following pull request and provide feedback in a structured JSON array format. Each comment should include a category, summary, and metadata about the file path and line number. If applicable, include a start_line for multi-line comments.

Categories:
1. "LGTM âœ…" - Looks Good To Me, no changes needed.
2. "LOW ðŸ”µ" - Low priority changes, minor improvements.
3. "MEDIUM ðŸŸ¡" - Medium priority changes, may require some effort.
4. "HIGH ðŸŸ " - High priority changes, significant issues that must be addressed.
5. "CRITICAL ðŸ”´" - Critical issues, immediate attention required.

Guidelines:
- Focus on correctness, security, performance, readability.
- If everything looks good, return one object with category "LGTM âœ…".
- Use existing diff context; only reference lines that exist in the diff.
- For missing line info, default to path "src/index.ts" and line 1.
- For multi-line comments, ensure start_line < line.

Now analyze:

Pull Request Diff:
